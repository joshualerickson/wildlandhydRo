\description{
This function uses the USGS water data API to link a point to a realized basin. This is
not the same as delineating from the exact point, rather this API uses NLDI to find the closest
basin downstream source point. There is a lot you can do with this API and I would recommend
looking at {nhdplusTools} as that has a lot of functionality and better documentation.
