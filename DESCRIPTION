Title: Wildland Hydrology
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Josh Erickson
Maintainer: Josh Erickson <joshua.l.erickson@usda.gov>
Description: This is a package for wildland hydrologists but also anyone who uses hydroclimatic workflows.
    The goal is to create wrapper functions around commonly used packages like streamstats, dataRetrieval and snotelr and 
    provide accessible functions for culvert sizing, quick reports and EDA into extreme events. Basically, a package for me but 
    worth sharing with others.
